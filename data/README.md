# **Code Coverage**

This folder contains the raw data of code coverage achieved by HistFuzz and the baselines, i.e., OpFuzz, TypeFuzz, YinYang, and STORM, in the accepted paper. 

Here, we run each tool 20 times on our machine to mitigate the influence of randomness. Therefore, you can consider these data as a reference.
